## üöÄ Complete Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python** (v3.9 or higher) - [Download Here](https://www.python.org/)
- **PostgreSQL** (v12 or higher) - [Download Here](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **Git** - [Download Here](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/MyDuka-group-5.git
cd MyDuka-group-5
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup

#### 2.1 Navigate to the server directory
```bash
cd server
```

#### 2.2 Create and activate a virtual environment

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 2.3 Install Python dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2.4 Set up PostgreSQL database

**Create a new database:**
```bash
# Login to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres

# Create database
CREATE DATABASE myduka_db;

# Create user (optional)
CREATE USER myduka_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';

# Grant privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE myduka_db TO myduka_user;

# Exit
\q
```

#### 2.5 Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following configuration (update with your credentials):

```env
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://myduka_user:your_password@localhost:5432/myduka_db

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-here
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES=3600

# Email Configuration (Gmail example)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your-email@gmail.com

# Application Configuration
APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Note:** For Gmail, you need to generate an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833).

#### 2.6 Initialize the database

```bash
# Initialize migrations
flask db init

# Create initial migration
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"

# Apply migrations
flask db upgrade
```

#### 2.7 Seed the database (optional)

```bash
python seed.py
```

This creates sample data including:
- 1 Merchant account
- 2 Admin accounts
- 3 Clerk accounts
- Sample inventory items
- Sample supply requests

#### 2.8 Start the backend server

```bash
flask run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

You should see:
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Debug mode: on
```

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

#### 3.1 Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory

```bash
cd client
```

#### 3.2 Install Node.js dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3.3 Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:

```bash
